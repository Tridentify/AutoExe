# AutoExe
AutoExe is a helper function that can run code in Code Blocks through various means, i.e. World Code, and other Code Blocks, without having the need to click on the Code Block.

## <Description>
Global object `exe` has a few methods. These methods allow code to be executed through different means, for example, through World Code. AutoExe can also help by allowing a user to extend their code, as there is a limit for the number of characters in World Code. Using AutoExe and global object `exe`, a user can execute code in code blocks to initialise parts of their World Code.

`exe` also lets the user check whether a specific code block has been executed before. The user may also choose to remove a specific log of a code's execution.

However, the amount of characters in each code block is limited. It is recommended to write code such that it only takes up about three quarters of the screen. You can also use minified code to allow for more things to be executed. (Code can be minified in multiple websites and sources. My recommendation is [Minify JS](https://minify-js.com "Minify JS"))

## <Installation>
AutoExe can be installed into your Bloxd.io world by **copy-pasting the code below into World Code**.

## <Usage>
The usable methods of global object `exe` is listed below.
